Chandrayaan-1 was the first Indian lunar probe under the Chandrayaan program which was launched by the ISRO on October 22, 2008. The mission was a major boost to India's space program, as our country researched and developed its own technology to explore the Moon. The 2008 Mumbai attacks, also known as 26/11, are possibly the most significant and deadly terrorist attacks carried out on Indian soil.</p>
